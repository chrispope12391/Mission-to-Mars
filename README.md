# web-scraping-challenge
Created a launchable HTML file population with information regarding the planet Mars that was scraped from various websites.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository and title it as you please. My repository is titled "web-scraping-challenge.

1. Clone the new repository to your computer.

1. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the web scraping challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: Missions_to_Mars.

1. Add your notebook files to this folder as well as your flask app.

1. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Summary

The first thing we did was to create a jupyter notebook to create a road map for our app.py follow while creating a database to house all of our scraped Mars information. There are four different pieces we seeked to obtain:

1. The title and teaser article from the website Red Planet's featured article.
